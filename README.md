# Diagnosing Biases in Tropical Atlantic-Pacific Multi-Decadal Teleconnections Across CMIP6 and E3SM Models

This repository contains code and data for analyzing biases in tropical Atlantic-Pacific multi-decadal teleconnections across CMIP6 and E3SM climate models.

## Overview

The tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibit important multi-decadal variability that can influence global climate. This study examines how well current climate models capture these teleconnections and diagnoses systematic biases.

This figure shows the correlation coefficient of low pass filtered sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) on the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) index (1950-2015). The shading indicates the correlation coefficient and the black line indicates the 90% confidence interval.
